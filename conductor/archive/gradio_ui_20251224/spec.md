# Specification: Gradio Web Interface

## 1. Overview
This feature introduces a web-based user interface using Gradio to provide an accessible and interactive way to test the supported TTS and ASR models. It complements the existing CLI by enabling visual comparisons and immediate feedback.

## 2. Goals
- **Accessibility:** Allow users to test models without using the command line.
- **Interactivity:** Enable real-time adjustment of parameters (speed, voice, language) and immediate audio playback.
- **Comparison:** Facilitate side-by-side comparison of different models or settings.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to select a TTS model from a dropdown menu so I can easily switch between engines.
- As a user, I want to input text and generate speech, then immediately play it back in the browser.
- As a user, I want to upload an audio file and see its transcription generated by a selected ASR model.
- As a user, I want to upload a reference audio file for voice cloning models and hear the cloned result.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 TTS Tab
- **Model Selection:** Dropdown to choose between available TTS models (e.g., Kokoro, Chatterbox, Kitten, Marvis).
- **Inputs:**
    - Textbox for input text.
    - Reference Audio upload (for cloning models).
    - Slider for Speed.
    - Dropdown for Voice/Speaker (if applicable).
    - Dropdown for Language (if applicable).
- **Outputs:**
    - Audio player for the synthesized result.
    - Download button for the generated file.

### 4.2 ASR Tab
- **Model Selection:** Dropdown to choose between available ASR models (e.g., Parakeet, Canary, Whisper).
- **Inputs:**
    - Audio file upload (drag and drop).
    - Dropdown for Target Language (if applicable).
- **Outputs:**
    - Textbox displaying the transcription.
    - JSON viewer for timestamps (optional/advanced).

### 4.3 VAD Tab
- **Model Selection:** Dropdown (HumAware).
- **Inputs:** Audio file upload.
- **Outputs:** Text/JSON display of speech segments.

## 5. Technical Architecture
- **Framework:** Gradio (Python).
- **Integration:** The UI will import and call the existing model wrapper functions from `src/voice_cloning/`.
- **Entry Point:** A new script `app.py` or a subcommand `uv run python main.py --web`.

## 6. Constraints
- Must run locally.
- Must handle model loading/unloading gracefully to manage memory (optional optimization).
